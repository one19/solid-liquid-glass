# Slides template repo

[Deployed here](https://one19.github.io/slide-deck/)
[Storybook deployed here](https://one19.github.io/slide-deck/storybook/)

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Tech:
```
vite swc
eslint
tseslint
prettier
mdx
storybook
@emotion/styled
```

Steps to use:
1. clone template
2. change the name from `slide-deck`
3. add some slides in the slides folder
5. update the App to reference all the slides
6. push it, and enjoy the insta-compile on gh-action
7. think about deleting `dependabot` once cloned
8. backport cool stuff you make to the template so i can use it in the future


### todo

1. add a github logo linking back to the repo in a corner someplace
